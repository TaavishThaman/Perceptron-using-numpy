# Perceptron-using-numpy
This python file contains code for a simple perceptron created only using numpy and no deep learning framework.
A linearly seperable dataset was generated using sklearn's dataset.make_blobs function and was fed into the perceptron. 
This simple model achieved train accuracy of about 88.2% and test accuracy of 86.33% on the dataset.
Code for generating the dataset, building the perceptron and visualizing the results are all provided in the python file.
